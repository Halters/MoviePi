## Project identity
1. ### Why this project ?
We have found that finding a movie to watch is getting more and more difficult due to the increase of everyone's standards in matter of films and the common desire of watching new movies.

The most known streaming platforms still don't have a correct recommendation algorithm so we decided to create an alternative to these by providing a movie metadata search engine with recommendations.

2. ### What is interesting for you in this project ?
New technologies, new languages and new area of knowledge in connection with cinema.

Have a first approach with Kotlin and Android Studio and discover the world of the mobile development while setting a DevOps and Agile approach of the project while working in the cinema sector.

But also meet an unexpressed but important need.

3. ### Project management
3 peoples. The work can be cut in 3 parts and the group members are going to work on one or more of these parts :

Our program tester are: Krystel-Sophie Vicente.

 - Front End (Mobile Application).
 - Back End (Server-sided API and Database).
 - Organization and Management Agile (User stories, sprint, milestone, epics etc...), Scrum.

## Project functionnality
1.  ### Requirements

What the project *MUST do*  

 - Get a large enough film metadata list. (Movies since the 60's with a 100k+ box office worldwide)
 - Be able to use metadata and search inside the metadata list.  
 - Let users have an account with a public page and watchlists.  
 - Save users' preferences for directors, genres and movies.  
 - Use this preference for find the best movie for the user.
 - Propose a list of suitable movie to the user with an algorithm.
 - Allow the user to review movies and especially the recommended ones.  
 - Be usable on Android devices.  
 
What the project *SHOULD do*  
 - Link the app to a streaming website (Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, etc.).
 - Improve the algorithm based on users' reviews for recommended movies.  

What the project *COULD do*  
 - Work on IOS.

2. ### Who are the users
All the people who enjoy watching movies, mostly new ones, and like to discover films which they would never have heard of without using this app.

 - Help people discover new movies.
 - Encourage users to rate movies' suggestions to improve them.

## Deployment
|Deployment|Front-End|Back-End|Back-End|
|---:|---|---|---|---|
|**Language/Techno**|Ionic|Python|RDBMS|
|**Platform target**|Mobile | Server-side API / DB|

1. ### Making
For the physic parts, we will use our personal cellphones for functional tests. 
For the virtual parts, we will use Thomas' server in the HUB.

This project is aimed primarily at all those who love movies and wants to discover new ones that they would be sure, or almost, to love.

2. ### Using technologies (extern dependency)
In this project, we will use Android Studio and we will learn a new language, Kotlin, for the front-end part.  
We will also use either GoLang or Python for the Server-side API and one of the hundreds RDBMS engines available for the Database.
